        now or hereafter in force and effect worldwide. You agree that you will not, and will not allow any third party to, (i) copy, sell, license,

        EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The Application may be subject to export controls or restrictions by the countries of the European Union, the United States of America, or other countries or territories.
        You agree to comply with all applicable international export laws and regulations. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use.<br>
        TERMINATION. These Terms and Conditions will continue to apply until terminated by either you or the Developer as set forth below. You may terminate these Terms and Conditions at
        any time by permanently deleting the Application from your mobile device in its entirety. Your rights automatically and immediately terminate without notice from the
        Developer or any Third Party if you fail to comply with any provision of these Terms and Conditions. In such event, you must immediately delete the Application.
        <br>INDEMNITY. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings,
        as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from your use of the Application,
        including your downloading, installation, or use of the Application, or your violation of these Terms and Conditions.
        <br>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. You expressly understand and agree that your use of the Application is at your sole discretion and risk and that the Application is provided as is and as available without warranty of any kind.
        You are solely responsible for any damage to your mobile device, or other devices, or loss of data that results from such use. The Developer further expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether expressed or implied,
        including, but not limited to the implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement, with respect to the Application. You expressly understand
        and agree that the Developer and his licensors are not liable to you under any theory of liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special consequential or exemplary damages that
        may be incurred by you through your use of the Application, including any loss of data or damage to your mobile device, whether or not the Developer have been advised of or should have been aware
        of the possibility of any such losses arising.
        <br>MISCELLANEOUS. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire Agreement between you and the Developer relating to the Application and govern your use of the Application, and completely
        replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and the Developer regarding the Application. The failure of the Developer to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision,
        which will still be available to the Developer. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms and Conditions is invalid, then that provision will
        be removed from the Terms and Conditions without affecting the rest of the Terms and Conditions. The remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions will continue
        to be valid and enforceable. The rights granted in these Terms and Conditions may not be assigned or transferred by either you or the Developer without the prior written approval of the other party.
        Neither you nor the Developer are permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without the prior written approval of the
        other party. These Terms and Conditions and your relationship with the Developer under these Terms and Conditions will be governed by the laws of Italy without regard to its conflict
        of laws provisions. You and the Developer agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Piacenza, Italy to resolve any legal matter arising from
        these Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding this, you agree that the Developer will still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent
        legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
